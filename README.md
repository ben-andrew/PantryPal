# **PantryPal**: Track Your Pantry Stock and Minimize Food Waste

## **Project Description**:
According to ReFED, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization aimed to stop food waste, almost half of the food waste in America is due to consumers; who, by the way, spent an average of almost 800 dollars each in 2023 on uneaten food! PantryPal is a mobile app that helps you to track your food stock, find recipes to use your current stock, and plan meals to avoid over-buying. With features such as a computer vision receipt scanner, recipe suggestion AI, and a stock manager, you can stop worrying about the hard questions like: “What should I make tonight?," “How can I use my leftover vegetables before they go bad?,” and “What do I need to buy this week?”

PantryPal. The app that food waste fears!

## **Proposed Features**: 
* Computer Vision Receipt Scanner: scan your receipts and quickly record all new stock items into your pantry.
